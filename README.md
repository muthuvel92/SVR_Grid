Notes from my learning on Step by step instruction for creating a Machine learning Model Medical Insurance Prediction using SVR Grid
Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a powerful regression technique in machine learning that utilizes the principles of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict continuous values. When optimizing SVR models, a Grid Search is often employed to find the best hyperparameters that improve model performance.
